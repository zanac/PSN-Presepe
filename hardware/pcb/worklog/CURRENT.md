# PCB work checkpoint

This file is the short restart point for long autonomous PCB sessions.

## Current baseline
- Branch: `dev`.
- Official board: `hardware/pcb/kicad/PSN-Presepe-Mega.kicad_pcb`.
- Official board currently contains **81 routed segments**.
- Routing is being promoted only after a temporary candidate passes real KiCad DRC.
- Current temporary candidate script targets the next relay-coil experiment after K4; always fetch it fresh because concurrent commits may advance it.
- Gerber fabrication gate remains blocked until DRC has no real errors and connectivity is complete.

## Restart procedure
1. Fetch HEAD versions of this file, `make_route_candidate.py`, `pcb_sanity.py`, PCB and workflow.
2. Inspect the newest `pcb-kicad.yml` Actions run and its logs/artifacts.
3. Never assume a candidate was promoted merely from its script: confirm the official PCB segment count and sanity allow-list.
4. If candidate DRC is clean and reduces connectivity, promote only that verified route in a dedicated commit.
5. Update this checkpoint after each meaningful routing milestone.
6. Keep experimental generated boards out of the official PCB; CI build paths are disposable.

## Commit discipline
Use small commits with one purpose:
- `WIP candidate: <net>` for experiment infrastructure or route candidate;
- `Promote KiCad-validated <net> route` only after clean candidate DRC;
- `Checkpoint PCB routing state` for this restart log;
- documentation/tooling changes separately from electrical PCB changes.

## Safety invariants
- Do not blind-route relay contact/mains-capable nets.
- No unreviewed copper zones.
- Preserve perimeter terminal placement and MOSFET heatsink spacing.
- Keep the explicit fabrication gate; never generate production Gerbers from an incomplete board.
- Fetch HEAD immediately before every PCB/tool/workflow update to avoid overwriting concurrent work.

## Next action
K4 (`RELAY4_COIL_LOW`) passed Routing Lab with 0 error-severity DRC violations and reduced unconnected 167 → 166; it was promoted in commit `c8a58e53350999d83ced2cef67cfb762959357a3`. Prepare and validate K5 next.
